## Red Hat AWX for Ansible on the AWS Cloud


This Quick Start deploys Red Hat AWX on the AWS Cloud, for users who want to run and manage an Ansible infrastructure on AWS.

AWX is an open-source community project that provides software for managing Ansible projects. AWX is hosted at GitHub and provides a web-based user interface, REST API, and task engine for Ansible.

The Quick Start offers two deployment options:

- Deploying AWX into a new virtual private cloud (VPC) on AWS
- Deploying AWX into an existing VPC on AWS

You can also use the AWS CloudFormation templates as a starting point for your own implementation.
